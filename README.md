# Guitar Chord Voicing Explorer

Copyright &copy; 2016 [Robert Kooima](https://kooima.net)

The Guitar Chord Voicing Explorer presents an interactive guitar fretboard diagram. Select a root note and a set of chord tones to mark all relevant positions on the fretboard. Configure a chord by clicking to mark selected positions. This generates a <a href="http://lilypond.org">Lilypond</a> chord and fretboard diagram.

Fretboard controls create, delete, and reorder fretboard diagrams.
