# Yet Another Fretboard Diagram Generator

Copyright &copy; 2015 [Robert Kooima](https://kooima.net)

This is yet another guitar fretboard diagram generator. This one outputs scalable SVG graphics that can be viewed in the browser, saved, and printed. It includes definitions for the guitar, bass guitar, and ukulele. Several diagrams may be displayed side-by-side for comparison. The configuration GUI is omitted from printed output, making for easily-printable reference material.
